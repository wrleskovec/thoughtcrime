2. create vertical menu for OptionsApp with logo

3. Finish OptionsApp layout with top visited sites list and their percentage of daily total (obviously ignore anything irrelevant) then generate chart using d3.js using our lovely book on d3/react.

4. Create intra extension routing for options page

5. Create an additional page for statistics for week, month, all time, ability to create a custom chart page, filtering, options/export/import json settings file
